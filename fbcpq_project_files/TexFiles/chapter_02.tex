\section{Introduction}
The following lecture notes have been compiled by combining personal notes taken during class, personal highlights from the lecture slides, and targeted use of generative AI. The AI was provided with my notes and the highlighted slides, together with carefully designed prompts, to ensure that it focused on the most relevant and interesting aspects of each lecture. This approach aims to produce a coherent and focused summary that reflects both the course content and my individual learning perspective.
